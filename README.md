The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of DOM manipulation, using what I've learned from 
The Odin Project.

[Here is the TOP project assignment page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

The project is to create an Etch-a-Sketch that is                       adjustable, using Flexbox and JavaScript.
